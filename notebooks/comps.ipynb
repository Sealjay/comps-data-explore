       "Boundaryless career refers to a career that transcends traditional organizational boundaries, such as departmental identity and job duties that are ambiguous (Miner & Robinson, 1994), and encompasses physical and/or psychological mobility (Sullivan & Arthur, 2006). Protean career, on the other hand, emphasizes a self-directed approach to the career that is driven by personal values (Briscoe & Hall, 2006) and involves competencies in \"knowing-why,\" \"knowing-how,\" and \"knowing-whom\" (Guan, Arthur, & Khapova, 2019). Combining the two concepts results in 16 possible career profiles that vary in values-driven and self-directedness, as well as psychological and physical mobility (Briscoe & Hall, 2006)."
